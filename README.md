Neural Network in R - Balance Scale Data Set
In this assignments was performed a training procress using a MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) with three different learning functions. The three learning functions used were Std_Backpropagation (Backpropagation),  main goal here is to compare the accuracy of these learning functions.
